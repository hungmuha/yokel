		          <p class="">The red onion is awesome! Elk Bolognese is comforting and delicious. I dont think the pasta is fresh but it was cooked perfectly. The soft cheese on top added a creamy, cool accompaniment. At 23 bucks in this town you cant get much better without spending a lot more. We also enjoyed a burger that was cooked to medium with a little pink inside, soooo juicy. The side salad had radishes, carrots, and other vegetables which sets it worlds apart from other restaurants that give you iceberg, were it seems like an after thought.</p> <span class="date sub-text">August 31st, 2017 <strong>from Joe D.</strong></span>

		          <p class="">Little Nell for five nights during the JAS festival this Labor Day. I was so impressed with every detail in this hotel. The service was always AMAZING! The hotel room was more than I expected; very clean, modern, and every little detail was spot on. I checked in with two dogs & there were 2 dog beds placed by the fireplace when I checked in. The food at the hotel was delicious, just the right portion size. I highly recommend the gnocchi!! â€˜);</p> <span class="date sub-text">August 31st, 2017 <strong>from Hung M.</strong></span>
